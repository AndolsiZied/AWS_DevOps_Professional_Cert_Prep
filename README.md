## 1. Foundational Services

### Goals:
- Gain a solid understanding of AWS core services.
- Practice deploying and managing resources with a focus on scalability and monitoring.

### Exercise: Deploy a Scalable Application
**Scenario:** Deploy a web application using EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling Group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure private subnets and Route 53 for domain resolution.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Create a VPC with public and private subnets across two Availability Zones.
  2. Deploy EC2 instances in private subnets using an Auto Scaling Group.
  3. Configure an ALB in public subnets.
  4. Use Route 53 to set up DNS for the ALB.
  5. Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor CPU utilization and send email notifications.
  6. Ensure instances are not accessible via SSH.

- **Outcome:** A fully functional and monitored application with high availability.

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Automation

### Goals:
- Understand and implement Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.
- Automate resource provisioning and configuration management.

### Exercise: Automate the Foundational Services
**Scenario:** Recreate the foundational application deployment from Section 1 using Terraform.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Write Terraform configurations to define the VPC, subnets, and security groups.
  2. Automate the deployment of EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, and ALB.
  3. Use Terraform modules to structure the codebase.
  4. Integrate pre-commit hooks for syntax checks and security validations with Checkov.
  5. Test the deployment with a simulated load to validate the scaling policies.

- **Outcome:** An automated deployment pipeline with reusable and maintainable code.
